# Arduino Encoder Demo
Demonstrates how to use a rotary encoder for input in an Arduino sketch. Tested on ESP32.

## Hardware
The controller I used is the DoIt ESP32 Devkit V1. I purchased it from AliExpress [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32659152063.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.42ab4c4dlEfLZD)

The encoder I selected uses Gray encoding and has detents on every other step. It also has an integrated push button. It was also sourced from AliExpress, [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2050939127.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.42ab4c4dlEfLZD)

I also used an RGB LED with current limiting resistors.
